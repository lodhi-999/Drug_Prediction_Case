# Drug Recommendation System using Machine Learning

XYZ Pharma Company/Hospital aims to build a machine learning model to predict the most suitable drug type for patients based on their details. This project explores various classification algorithms to achieve this goal.

---

## Algorithms Used
1. **KNN Classification**
2. **Decision Tree Classification**
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
4. **Random Forest**

---

## Steps Performed

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning was not required as no `NaN` values were present in the dataset.
- Verified and confirmed that no duplicate data points were found.

### 2. Data Visualization
- **Bar Plot**: Visualized the count of different drug types.
- **Heatmap**: Explored the correlation between **Age** and **Na_to_K**.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- Applied **Label Encoding** for all categorical variables to prepare the data for machine learning models.

### 4. Machine Learning Model Comparison
- Performed classification using the following algorithms:
  - **Random Forest Classifier**
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - **Decision Tree**
  - **KNN Classifier**
- **Key Insight**: Random Forest, SVM, and Decision Tree models were the most effective, while KNN performed less effectively in this case.

### 5. Predicting the Best Drug for Patients
- From the analysis, **Drug Y** emerged as the most effective drug for patients based on the dataset.

---

## Key Findings
- **Drug Y** is identified as the best recommendation for most patients.
- Random Forest and SVM are highly effective in predicting drug types, showcasing strong model performance compared to KNN.

## Visualizations
Visualizations (bar plots and heatmaps) provide further insights into the dataset and correlations between variables.
